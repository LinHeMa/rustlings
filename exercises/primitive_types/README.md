# Primitive Types

Rust has a couple of basic types that are directly implemented into the
compiler. In this section, we'll go through the most important ones.

## Further information

In the code let a = ["Are we there yet?"; 100];, the statement let a declares a new variable named a.

The ["Are we there yet?"; 100] part is an array initializer. It creates an array with 100 elements, where each element is the string literal "Are we there yet?". This syntax is called an array initializer shorthand.

So, the line let a = ["Are we there yet?"; 100]; initializes the variable a as an array with 100 elements, where each element is the string "Are we there yet?".
